# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning models. By analyzing user-specific features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region, our models provide accurate predictions that can help insurance companies optimize pricing strategies and improve risk assessment.

We use the Medical Insurance Dataset from Kaggle:
